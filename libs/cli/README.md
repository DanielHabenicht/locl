# Locl CLI

Dev tools to help you with `$localize` and Angular i18n.

## Installation

Install the cli tools with npm:

```sh
npm install @locl/cli --save-dev
```

## Usage

You can get a full list of commands with `npx locl --help`.

### Extraction

You can use `locl extract` to extract translations from your ivy application:

```
locl extract -s=dist/apps/demo/*.js -f=json -o=dist/i18n/en.json
```

The extraction tool will find any call to `$localize` within your bundle files (in code and in templates),
but there is a limitation inherent to the way Angular files are generated by the compiler:
**you need to build your application with the AOT mode to generate template translations using `$localize`.**
Always use `--prod` or `--aot` when you build your application.

#### Options:

- `--source` (`-o`): A glob pattern indicating what files to search for translations, e.g. `./dist/**/*.js`. This can be absolute or relative to the current working directory.
- `--format` (`-f`): the format of the translation file to generate. Either `xlf`, `xlf2`, `xmb` or `json`.
- `--outputPath` (`-o`): A path to where the translation file will be written. This can be absolute or relative to the current working directory.
